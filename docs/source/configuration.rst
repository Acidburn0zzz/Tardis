Configuration
=============

Tardis provides multiple levels of configuration:
   * Built in defaults
      Sensible defaults are built into all of tardis's various programs
   * System Defaults
      A system level file, usually /etc/tardis/system.defaults, contains default values that will be applied to all users on the system.
   * Environment Variables
      Users can specify environment variables that override the system defaults
   * Configuration files
      Configuration files for some tools can override the above defaults
   * Command line arguments
